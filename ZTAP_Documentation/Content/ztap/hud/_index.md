The **HUD** screen is where most of the work in ZTAP is done. The main view lists the currently open Alerts based on any default search criteria you have selected. For information on individual Alerts, see [Working with individual Alerts](#working-with-individual-alerts).

### Alerts interface
![HUD main screen](/ztap/media/alerts_main.png)

1. **HUD**: The top information bar provides a quick view of the number, status, and types of Alerts in your environment.
2. **Search**: The Search feature uses key/value pairs to display a subset of Alerts. Start typing to see a list of matching keys for your search. You can add multiple key/value pairs to continue narrowing your results. If you use a specific set of search terms often, you can save your search. Click the folder icon to access your saved searches. The Alert count below the search bar shows the total number of Alerts that match your search criteria. If no additional search criteria are specified, this will default to the total number of open Alerts in your environment.
3. **Bulk actions**: Select specific Alerts to take action on them without opening each Alert separately. You can also click the box beside the Alert count to select all of the Alerts in your current search. Under **More actions**, you can Export to CSV (downloads a .csv file with the Alert details), Update (add a comment to the selected Alerts), and Close Alert (closes the Alerts with no additional action). You can also change the sorting criteria here.
4. **Alert metadata**: This section shows the name of the Alert, Organization where it occurred, the Created or Last Updated date, and any Category and Priority tags associated with the Alert. If necessary, you can click the Category or Priority modify those tags. You can use the **Preview** toggle to see a more detailed view of the Alerts in the list. You can also click the name of the Alert to see the full details of that Alert. See [Working with individual Alerts](#working-with-individual-alerts).
   - **Expanded Alert view**: When you use the **Preview** toggle, you can see additional details for the initial trigger event that generated the Alert. Click **See All** to go to the full details for the Alert.
   - **Product details**: This section shows the product that sent the trigger event, the number events from that product, and the total number of events associated with the Alert. From this section, you can pivot directly into the Alert Timeline, Comments, or Audit Logs for the Alert. You can also see and add tags to the Alert.
5. **Alert Actions**: Shows the actions you can take on the individual Alert and the user or group that the Alert is currently assigned to.
6. **Tasks**: Show all of the open Alerts that currently are assigned to you or that you have escalated.

### Working with individual Alerts
Click the title of an individual alert to open the Alert details screen.

![TOC](/ztap/media/alerts_detail.png)
Open an Alert to access the Threat Operations Center (**TOC**). Here you can see the full details of the Alert, all associated events, investigate, and take direct action.

1. **Alert metadata**: This section includes basic information about the Alert, including the creation date, Priority, Tags, Category, and assignment details. You can click the Priority or Category to change the current assignment. Similar Alerts will take you to a list of similar Alerts for the product.

2. **Event information tabs**: The information on these tabs can be useful for obtaining additional background information when you are investigating an Alert. For more information on the types of events, see [Event Tiers](/ztap/hud/event_tiers/)

   - **Trigger Events** (Tier 1): These are the specific events that caused the Alert to be created and are considered "high-value" from an investigation perspective.
   - **Oberservations** (Tier 2): Events that do not create an Alert, but could provide additional context. These types are generally categorized by a [Filter](/ztap/orchestration/filters/) within ZTAP.
   - **Whitelisted Events** (Tier 3): This tab contains related events that have been previously whitelisted by a [List](/ztap/orchestration/lists/), from a Whitelist action on previous Alert, or by the matching logic of a Filter.
   - **Timeline**: This tab includes **Comments/Assignments** and **Auditlogs**. Use the **Auditlogs** toggle to switch views.
      - **Comments/Assignments**: This view shows all comments and assignments pertaining to the Alert in chronological order. Comments can be added manually or generated by the system based on Playbooks. Comments are the easiest way for customers and analysts to communicate regarding the status of an Alert.
      - **Auditlog**: This page shows all actions taken on the Alert and the user who performed them.
3. **Event details**: The most pertinent information about the event is displayed here. 
4. **Threat Analytics Plugins** (TAPs):  where you or CRITICAL**START** analysts can take action on the Alert. The specific options available will differ depending on the products you have installed in your environment and the type of event. Example TAP actions include pivoting to the product's console, isolating a system from the network, or sending a suspicious binary for additional investigation.
5. **Orchestration Actions**: These actions allow you to create a new Filter, whitelist an event, or create a new Playbook based on the details of the Alert.
6. **Alert Actions**: You can assign the Alert to yourself, add a Comment, Close, or Escalate the Alert.
