### Security
The Security screen allows you to view and create App Tokens and view your session token history. Use the drop-down menu to switch between **App tokens** and **Session tokens**

#### App tokens
App tokens allow you to connect ZTAP to other applications with API capabilities. 

To create an App Token:
1. Click the **Create App Token** button. 
2. Provide a name for the app and click **Generate**.
3. After the token is generated, copy the new App token immediately. 

   **IMPORTANT**: After you close the "App Token Created" page, you will no longer be able to copy the App token.

#### Session Tokens
This is where session tokens are stored for the logged in user account. These are generated during authentication to ZTAP and can be deleted by clicking trash icon beside each individual token.
