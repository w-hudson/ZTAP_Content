| [Lists](/ztap/orchestration/lists/) | Lists are created directly from within an Alert to add a hash value to either the white or black list. |
| [Feeds](/ztap/orchestration/feeds/) | Feeds are collections of static values that can be used to replace the value in a key/value pair in Filters and Playbooks. |
