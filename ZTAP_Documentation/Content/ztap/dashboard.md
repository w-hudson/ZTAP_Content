The Dashboard gives you at-a-glance information about the Alerts in your environment. Use the arrow icons in the upper right corner of each dashboard widget to set its location on the page.

Use the Settings gear icon in the upper right to enable or disable specific dashboard widgets. Use the Height dropdown menu to constrain the height of individual dashboard widgets.

**NOTE**: Dashboards is currently in place to retain functionality from the previous ZTAP user interface and much of the functionality here will be migrated to the Home screen later.
