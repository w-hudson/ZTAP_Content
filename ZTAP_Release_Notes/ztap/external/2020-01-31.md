## Enhancements
- Improved start and finish comments, and finish audit logs for all asynchronous TAPs. Comments and logs are now more consistent across endpoint products and many now include additional context from the trigger events. |


## Bug Fixes

- Modified ordering on the scheduled reports screen to sort from newest to oldest.

- Resolved a User API issue that resulted in some crashes on the MOBILE**SOC** user details screen.
- Resolved an issue that prevented users from adding attachments on support requests.
- Changed the label for "Cb Response" to "CB Response" to match Carbon Black's branding.
