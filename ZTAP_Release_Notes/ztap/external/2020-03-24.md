## New Features
- Added endpoint count report for Defender ATP.
- Added Release Notes pages.
- Added functionality to generate multi-factor authentication (MFA) code for products. This allows ZTAP to use MFA for logging in to a product tenant. This feature is available from the Subscription details page if MFA is enabled for that product.

## Enhancements
- Changed the order of **Current** and **Purchased** count columns in the Endpoints report.

## Bug Fixes
- Resolved an issue where values added to a Feed did not show changes pending after the new values were saved.
