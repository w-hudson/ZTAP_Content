## Enhancements
- Cylance detection rule data is now included in Cylance Optics events to help users understand why an event was generated.
- Created a new **CB Defense Console (Alert)** TAP to pivot directly to the Alerts area of the Carbon Black Defense console. Renamed current CB Defense console TAP to **CB Defense Console (Investigate)**.

## Bug Fixes
- The SLA Timer will no longer be displayed when an Alert is escalated from a grandchild Organization (a child Organization of a child Organization) to the top-level parent Organization.
- Resolved an API issue with retrieving large amounts of endpoint data from Palo Alto XDR. Reporting and device count data for XDR endpoints will now be fetched in chunks.
